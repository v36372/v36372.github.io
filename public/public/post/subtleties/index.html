            <p>Everyday I travel to work by a 15 years old motorbike. Earphone plugged, helmet buckled and I&rsquo;m ready to roll. The feeling of igniting this rusty engine is autonomous and comforting. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the only thing I look forward of a new day.</p>

<p>I easily pass through the familiar commute condensed with commuters. I think of my driving as a ninja, soundless. In Vietnam, people mostly use the honk as a device to rudely ask for a way. So, interestingly, frustration is also a byproduct to make progress. For me personally, I don&rsquo;t touch the button because I despise its annoying sound. I simply cant trade a good mood to go a little faster, its not even close. This little choice adds in my subtleties.</p>

<p>I stop by the regular breakfast store and buy a small pack of chicken sticky rice. I take off my sunglasses as an act of politeness, checkout and put it back on. Even I am the person using the service, never once a thank you sealed in a subtle smile is absent. I carry on my journey, leaving behind nothing but a joyful store owner. The tiny gestures embedded in my social encounter adds in my subtleties.</p>

<p>Finally arrived at the workplace, I have to park my bike first. The parking service here is very amusing. Every company rent office here have to pay parking fee prior every month, but they don&rsquo;t have or don&rsquo;t care to create the database of employees. Therefore, they have to ask every person coming in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 thousand Dong, pls</p>

<p>Oh, you work here? Ok, go ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every single morning, I have this mundane conversation with a young dude trying to be opportunist to have an extra 5.000 Dong. The irony is that if you pay the ticket once and the next time don&rsquo;t, accusations for lying are gonna be tossed around. What is interesting is that he doesn&rsquo;t seem to believe my identity but always let me through with a cloud of doubt over his head. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get rid of this awkward situation once and for all. By repeating some actions when interacting with him, I can make him remember me as a member of this building. First, I take off my sunglasses, unplugged one of my earbuds. Then I say aloud my bike registration number:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5327</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not forget the smiled thank-you, I take the parking ticket and bounce right away as if I&rsquo;m a regular customer, which I am indeed. I&rsquo;ve been  practicing this scheme for a week, hoping one day my subtleties sink in and he accept me through the gate. The one that I&rsquo;m ironically privileged of.</p>

<p>So, what is your subtleties?</p>
