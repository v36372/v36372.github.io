                <p><em>Hi Education, my lady</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s surprising to realize that we&rsquo;ve known each other for a really long time, yet this is the first time we talk, like really? Our first met was so humble that I hardly recognize you from the images.
You was so complicated yet so beautiful. The way you could instantly tell whether
a number is prime was so attractive that guys keep giving
you arbitrary numbers just to hear your voice. I was in love, blindly. As time passes, I tried so
hard to befriend with you. Make friend with the librarian, apprentice the most evil profs, kill the last light, I&rsquo;ve done it all.
Fortunately, it was okay, for a while. Until one day, your complexity hit me like a train. I knew that train would
come one day, but damn &hellip; that algorithm.

You changed so fast I couldn&rsquo;t even look you in the eyes, your beautiful
eyes. Even thinking about you horrified me, I was suffocated as your big Os slowly appearing in my mind. Seeing you hanging
out with other guys amplified the pain inside even more. Soon, my endurance maxed out and I dropped. You were my first, one-sided love,
yet I cowardly turned tail and ran. How miserable is that? I let the gods decide. Today, I am writing this not to pledge empathy but to seek redemption for my own mistake.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I dwell in the past or something, but this is a good occasion for me to do this.

</blockquote>

<p><em>As time passes, I entered university to be even more miserable. Like wtf? We went to the same school, again. I was drowning in
the battles inside my own head. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt your parents feelings as they asked me to take care of you, but on the other hand I would have to lie to myself doing so because frankly, I disgust you to my core. I thought you would become mature with uni, but no, somehow you leave your beauty back in high school, you changed. At uni, you turn yourself into a joke, and I got news for you, it was not funny. The way I saw it, you and your friends was a big-ass joke walking around in the uni, while everyone else pretend to attentively listen and laugh. &ldquo;Ha ha ha&rdquo;. You guys made me sick. Ironically, doctors aren&rsquo;t supposed to make me sick, but your friends did. The worst part is I was trapped in this rat race. In case you haven&rsquo;t notice, your parents gave me money, a lot of money, just to look after you. I couldn&rsquo;t give up, and it&rsquo;s a bad thing. Couple months passed, I stopped whining and accepted the rules. I lied to myself playing your parents game, while try my best govern the rage inside. What&rsquo;s worse than 2 faces liar? I let the gods decide.</em></p>

<p><em>I am sorry for putting all over you like this, I truly am. I know now, it is not entirely because of you that I become so toxic towards love matters. I&rsquo;ve been single for 3 years, and it just recently that I open myself more than often. I&rsquo;d met this girl, her name is W. Right now, dating with her make me feel good about myself, I&rsquo;ll see how this goes. More importantly, I know now that your parents is the reason why we couldn&rsquo;t be together, it&rsquo;s not entirely your fault. But I can&rsquo;t blame them too, parents always wish the best for their child, right? Okay, the letter&rsquo;s getting long now, I better pause and reserve the good stuff for later. This is my first letter for you, there would be more, when the time comes. I am looking forward to your reply.</em></p>

<p><em>Best regards,</em></p>

<p><em>T</em></p>

<p><em>P/s: How&rsquo;s you parents doing? Is Mr. Government still lives alone? Send my regards for your parents,okay? You should take better care of them, I heard there&rsquo;s a virus called democracy going around.</em></p>
