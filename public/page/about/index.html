<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Hi, I am Tin, a software engineer based in Saigon, Vietnam.</p>

<p>I love building software and products in general.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m bored, reading and writing are my options to escape reality. Like computers, right? I/O operations are the most common activities.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently work at <a href="http://floatingcube.com">Floating Cube Studios</a>, also based in Saigon. We develop point of sale products and packages for small to middle size clients in Singapore.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t call myself a writer, but I&rsquo;m trying to fit in the writing habit.
There&rsquo;s something about crafting sentences that lures me into creating this blog and start putting my thoughts online.
I personally think the choice of words is art.
Strangely, I can&rsquo;t write in my mother tongue, yet, the feeling of cringing keeps striking me.
It&rsquo;s something I definitely should work on, as this practice of literacy possibly be my main activity in the next 10 years.
And writing in English is not a good approach for a non-native speaker, in a country that doesn&rsquo;t speak the language.
At the moment, I&rsquo;m enjoying the freedom of burden and write whatever I want.
But in the long run, screenwriting is what I&rsquo;m aiming for.</p>

<p>If you are a writer of any kind and located in Saigon, drop me a buzz and I buy you a drink! ;)</p>
