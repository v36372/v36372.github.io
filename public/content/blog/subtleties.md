Everyday I travel to work by a 15 years old motorbike. Earphone plugged, helmet buckled and I'm ready to roll. The feeling of igniting this rusty engine is autonomous and comforting. Sometimes it's the only thing I look forward of a new day.

I easily pass through the familiar commute condensed with commuters. I think of my driving as a ninja, soundless. In Vietnam, people mostly use the honk as a device to rudely ask for a way. So, interestingly, frustration is also a byproduct to make progress. For me personally, I don't touch the button because I despise its annoying sound. I simply cant trade a good mood to go a little faster, its not even close. This little choice adds in my subtleties.

I stop by the regular breakfast store and buy a small pack of chicken sticky rice. I take off my sunglasses as an act of politeness, checkout and put it back on. Even I am the person using the service, never once a thank you sealed in a subtle smile is absent. I carry on my journey, leaving behind nothing but a joyful store owner. The tiny gestures embedded in my social encounter adds in my subtleties.

Finally arrived at the workplace, I have to park my bike first. The parking service here is very amusing. Every company rent office here have to pay parking fee prior every month, but they don't have or don't care to create the database of employees. Therefore, they have to ask every person coming in:

>5 thousand Dong, pls

>Oh, you work here? Ok, go ahead.

Every single morning, I have this mundane conversation with a young dude trying to be opportunist to have an extra 5.000 Dong. The irony is that if you pay the ticket once and the next time don't, accusations for lying are gonna be tossed around. What is interesting is that he doesn't seem to believe my identity but always let me through with a cloud of doubt over his head. I've been trying to get rid of this awkward situation once and for all. By repeating some actions when interacting with him, I can make him remember me as a member of this building. First, I take off my sunglasses, unplugged one of my earbuds. Then I say aloud my bike registration number:

> 5327

Not forget the smiled thank-you, I take the parking ticket and bounce right away as if I'm a regular customer, which I am indeed. I've been  practicing this scheme for a week, hoping one day my subtleties sink in and he accept me through the gate. The one that I'm ironically privileged of.

So, what is your subtleties?
