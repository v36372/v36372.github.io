The reasons why I created this blog.

## I want to write.

I can feel the urge to write down something that clicks people. I want to do it. And I
doing it right now. It is one of the main reasons why I'm combining my limited vocabularies
to create something barely works.

> Writing is about eliminating poor choice of words.

## I want to record my mind.

There are a lot of things happend in a day and it's hard to recall everything. So it's better to have a place where
you can filter the good stuff and write it down.

To create stories, we need materials. It's in everyday life if we know where to look.

## The idea of having something your own is liberating.
