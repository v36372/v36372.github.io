When the words don't flow naturally, I find writing not fun anymore. Of course we need an idea up front, but even a small hard choice of vocabulary can entirely block your river of ideas, like a big stubborn stone. Then you try to move it away. Sometimes it takes 30 seconds, ideally. But if you stuck there too long, this indicates you are saving the wrong river. Simply find another one. Arguably, some rivers lead to gold. If it's really that valuable then you can dig a branch from the original river. This piece feels strangely natural to write, but it's the start of an expected broke up.

As a amateur writer, I find ranting on the Internet like this doesn't help me finding the answers at all. Most of the things I wrote are personal, not for everyone. Yeah you got 1 or 2 cool ideas integrated to beautify your point but that's it. I'm not getting any closer to the professional level. Ranting doesn't get you a writing contract. Not only the method but also the habit is bad. In the past I only write when I have time, energy, solid base idea, 1 coffee and 1 cat. Sometimes distractions are also present to delay the work. It's time to take the leap out of this well. 

Starting question: What kind of writing I want and need. Some loves flashy sentences and solid arguments. While others prefer rhythmic poem and touching usage of words. I personally find conversation really challenging and fun to replicate. Why some incidents are only fun when it happens but not when told in words? How can we casually pick up the laughter simply by gossiping with friends? What elements are there that made a situation hilarious? Now that questions are declared, I know what I want.

I've figured out the turning question. Why dont write short story that make heavy use of dialogue? I love simulating this tennis game of words. Conversation is like hitting the ball back and forth. I also find excitement in the subtlety hidden behind everyday talk. Plus, this too aligns with my long term goal of screenwriting. A better match than my tinder's. 


The big mountain of habits is harder to deal with. I know that, inspirations are rare. I can't just rely on this and hope they found me. Why not tame this animal and make it work for me? I only need to do my part, that is of course writing, inspiration might come or might not, doesn't matter. What does is my display of consistency. Sooner or later inspiration would come, and I want it besides me every single midnight, not just a 1 night stand. 

This piece is about my change of heart. Randomly scraping words isn't my favorite lady anymore. So it's maybe the best time to chime in my blog as this isn't about ranting anymore. I will write short stories. It's just life. Marriage isn't for kids that are constantly on and off. Time to change and look for a woman that can cook, LUL.

Peace,

Tin
