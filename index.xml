      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Think I probably quit playing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says while staring at the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this for like &amp;hellip; 2 months?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, but you know, things get in the way&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That is the worst excuse you can give&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; So? What happened&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was nothing, just that I played terribly is all&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now you&amp;rsquo;re lying. No wonder she said it&amp;rsquo;s so difficult to get something out of you&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She said that? When?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now you care? Say you tell your story, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell mine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fine, you got me&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hehe, I&amp;rsquo;m your best friend&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I got scolded by the instructor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So you hit him and got suspended?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m serious. But yeah, that would be worth it to quit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You hate him that much?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everybody hates him&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wow, then he must be very good to have so many haters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, he&amp;rsquo;s pretty good. But hey, which side are you on?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry. What did he do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He shouted at me for not in tune&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You could&amp;rsquo;ve been killed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal, we was just practicing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay. Maybe he pressure you to play better?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, he was just fucking with students I&amp;rsquo;m sure as hell&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like abuse them mentally?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah like that, one time he made a little girl cry for not bringing the sheets&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This bastard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right? Right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;re you gonna do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Guess find another class. This asshole is too toxic to nurture my music talent&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You aren&amp;rsquo;t gonna quit anymore? I saved a future musician hehe&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lul, it&amp;rsquo;s something called strong will&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Give me a break&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So did she say anything else about me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Which one?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wait, are we talking about the same girl?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Omg, quick, say theirs hair color out at once&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blonde&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wait, think I should call someone&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In that moment of desicion, I suddenly want to talk to her&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hehe, beers solve problems I guess&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;True that, hehe&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Change of Heart</title>
      <link>https://v36372.github.io/blog/change-of-heart/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2017 03:29:49 +0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the words don&amp;rsquo;t flow naturally, I find writing not fun anymore. Of course we need an idea up front, but even a small hard choice of vocabulary can entirely block your river of ideas, like a big stubborn stone. Then you try to move it away. Sometimes it takes 30 seconds, ideally. But if you stuck there too long, this indicates you are saving the wrong river. Simply find another one. Arguably, some rivers lead to gold. If it&amp;rsquo;s really that valuable then you can dig a branch from the original river. This piece feels strangely natural to write, but it&amp;rsquo;s the start of an expected broke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a amateur writer, I find ranting on the Internet like this doesn&amp;rsquo;t help me finding the answers at all. Most of the things I wrote are personal, not for everyone. Yeah you got 1 or 2 cool ideas integrated to beautify your point but that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any closer to the professional level. Ranting doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you a writing contract. Not only the method but also the habit is bad. In the past I only write when I have time, energy, solid base idea, 1 coffee and 1 cat. Sometimes distractions are also present to delay the work. It&amp;rsquo;s time to take the leap out of this well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting question: What kind of writing I want and need. Some loves flashy sentences and solid arguments. While others prefer rhythmic poem and touching usage of words. I personally find conversation really challenging and fun to replicate. Why some incidents are only fun when it happens but not when told in words? How can we casually pick up the laughter simply by gossiping with friends? What elements are there that made a situation hilarious? Now that questions are declared, I know what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out the turning question. Why dont write short story that make heavy use of dialogue? I love simulating this tennis game of words. Conversation is like hitting the ball back and forth. I also find excitement in the subtlety hidden behind everyday talk. Plus, this too aligns with my long term goal of screenwriting. A better match than my tinder&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big mountain of habits is harder to deal with. I know that, inspirations are rare. I can&amp;rsquo;t just rely on this and hope they found me. Why not tame this animal and make it work for me? I only need to do my part, that is of course writing, inspiration might come or might not, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. What does is my display of consistency. Sooner or later inspiration would come, and I want it besides me every single midnight, not just a 1 night stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece is about my change of heart. Randomly scraping words isn&amp;rsquo;t my favorite lady anymore. So it&amp;rsquo;s maybe the best time to chime in my blog as this isn&amp;rsquo;t about ranting anymore. I will write short stories. It&amp;rsquo;s just life. Marriage isn&amp;rsquo;t for kids that are constantly on and off. Time to change and look for a woman that can cook, LUL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tin&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obsession</title>
      <link>https://v36372.github.io/blog/obsession/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 23:16:29 +0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://v36372.github.io/blog/obsession/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, I apologize for this long and unexpected email. I like to write down and arrange everything, something I can&amp;rsquo;t do in face to face encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you knew, I am a software engineer. But it seems that I also have genuine passion toward creative creation in general. Say it cheesy but I feel like making something that I hope would carry a mission to change, even smallest as possible, something fundamental even, on the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In specifics, writing screenplay catches my attention recently. I see the potential in crafting dialogues and scenes, how it can transform into movies. Movies that tell stories with powerful devices to transform audience into better versions of themselves. I hope my work would spark a little thought of kindness in people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But painfully, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like starting to work on this. I dont have a drive to move me forward. Clouds of doubts shadows the writing notebook. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where this writing path would lead me to. After all it&amp;rsquo;s the creative product making that I am interested in, and this can happen in a lot of other fields, even at my current career as establishing a tech startup. Why jump into this high risk playground?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, another thing I like doing is playing football. I play every Monday and Thursday. Those are the weekdays I look forward to. Honestly, deep down, there is a call for professional football. And it is a shame that I became aware of this a bit too late. Kids would aim to go pro in football when they turn 10. Me,  a 22 years old dude with height issue, questioning about the ridiculous chances I might have in this career. But I can imagine, it would be a definitively joyful journey. Playing football everyweek gives me a glimpse of my distant yet surely happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my plan is to cross the professional football path and go for something else sustainable to provide for my regular football hobby. It feels like chopping one finger off and comforting yourself at the same time as you have nine left. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s okay as long as I am on the field. This fact describes my drives for the sport to some degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the problem. I am obsessed with this game. It gives me trouble sleeping as I would spend hours nightly thinking about the whatifs in the previous football match. What I could&amp;rsquo;ve done. I subconsciously recall the details of my touches with the ball and how I handled each situation. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but drowning in the stream of thougths about my performance. I am obsessed with this game. Eyes closed but my body still reacts to the moves I wished I would&amp;rsquo;ve played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d experienced this before. It was when I play DotA 2 for hours before going to sleep in 3 am only because of morning school. Still, lying on the bed doesnt make me sleepy. I keep thinking about the choices, actions I made in the past games. Sometimes even worse, I open the laptop and browse to the match statistics site, only to check the numbers and winrate. Going pro in DotA 2 sometimes even pass by  to say hello and disappears right away. Lucky I still had some senses left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behavior I presented is the kind I want for my serious work. I want to be hypnotized like that in my writing game. Something is missing. Is there a logical explanation for this? Or it is just simple that everyone would fall into a blackhole created by themselves if they overspend time into something? Is it just some people would simply prefer games, playful, relaxing activities over &amp;ldquo;creative work&amp;rdquo;? What can I do to feel the way I want to feel about my dream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best regards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tin NG&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P/s: I wrote this on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The best Golang web framework for you</title>
      <link>https://v36372.github.io/code/the-best-golang-web-framework-for-you/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 23:16:29 +0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://v36372.github.io/code/the-best-golang-web-framework-for-you/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;don-t-use-framework&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use framework&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard library has everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of Go doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie in concurrency like you may imagine. But instead in the design of &lt;code&gt;interfaces&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say in Go, you have a function that accepts an interface as a parameter. And you have another &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; that implement every method of that interface. Then this struct is acceptable for the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a larger scope, every struct that implements all the methods of that interface is eligible for the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine this. You&amp;rsquo;re developing a web application in Golang, and the router is getting slower (for example), and you want to replace the it by something faster than the standard library one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be problematic if you use a web framework cause everything would be glued in 1 piece. On the other hand, you can just find a router implementation on Github and plug it in seamlessly. Because the opensource router was implemented to conform to the standard library &lt;code&gt;router&lt;/code&gt; interface, so that your program would accept it with no problem at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read up more about interfaces at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jordanorelli.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go&#34;&gt;http://jordanorelli.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Subtleties</title>
      <link>https://v36372.github.io/blog/subtleties/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2016 02:40:55 +0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://v36372.github.io/blog/subtleties/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday I travel to work by a 15 years old motorbike. Earphone plugged, helmet buckled and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to roll. The feeling of igniting this rusty engine is autonomous and comforting. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing I look forward of a new day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I easily pass through the familiar commute condensed with commuters. I think of my driving as a ninja, soundless. In Vietnam, people mostly use the honk as a device to rudely ask for a way. So, interestingly, frustration is also a byproduct to make progress. For me personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t touch the button because I despise its annoying sound. I simply cant trade a good mood to go a little faster, its not even close. This little choice adds in my subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stop by the regular breakfast store and buy a small pack of chicken sticky rice. I take off my sunglasses as an act of politeness, checkout and put it back on. Even I am the person using the service, never once a thank you sealed in a subtle smile is absent. I carry on my journey, leaving behind nothing but a joyful store owner. The tiny gestures embedded in my social encounter adds in my subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally arrived at the workplace, I have to park my bike first. The parking service here is very amusing. Every company rent office here have to pay parking fee prior every month, but they don&amp;rsquo;t have or don&amp;rsquo;t care to create the database of employees. Therefore, they have to ask every person coming in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 thousand Dong, pls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you work here? Ok, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single morning, I have this mundane conversation with a young dude trying to be opportunist to have an extra 5.000 Dong. The irony is that if you pay the ticket once and the next time don&amp;rsquo;t, accusations for lying are gonna be tossed around. What is interesting is that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to believe my identity but always let me through with a cloud of doubt over his head. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get rid of this awkward situation once and for all. By repeating some actions when interacting with him, I can make him remember me as a member of this building. First, I take off my sunglasses, unplugged one of my earbuds. Then I say aloud my bike registration number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5327&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not forget the smiled thank-you, I take the parking ticket and bounce right away as if I&amp;rsquo;m a regular customer, which I am indeed. I&amp;rsquo;ve been  practicing this scheme for a week, hoping one day my subtleties sink in and he accept me through the gate. The one that I&amp;rsquo;m ironically privileged of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is your subtleties?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 months a sailor</title>
      <link>https://v36372.github.io/blog/6-months-a-sailor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2016 02:40:55 +0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://v36372.github.io/blog/6-months-a-sailor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I&amp;rsquo;m not publishing anything. My small little blog seems a little dusty I feel sticky
typing this new post. The past 6 months was wild, filled with events shall never fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my thesis project and successfully defended it against a board. A+ was a fair trade for the hardship I&amp;rsquo;d been
enduring for half a year. My graduation thesis was about Digital Signal Processing, a territory I&amp;rsquo;d never set foot on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it was uncomfortable since even with the sincere guidance from Mr. Nhut, my thesis instructor, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a
gasp of what to do. The Fourier series and all kind of transforms did their best morphing me into a DSP research student,
but all failed. That was when I know this academic journey wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me and I needed a different approach. It&amp;rsquo;s not
sticks and stones that can win this thesis battle, especially this engineering project. I needed brute force. Guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thesis boat had sailed but stranded. The worried instructor helplessly turned to me, his first research student,
and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re getting overpowered. You should swim back to land. I&amp;rsquo;ll defend those academica monsters for ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hesitated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your Fourier cannons won&amp;rsquo;t last long, you could di&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suddenly grabbed my shoulder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me son, it&amp;rsquo;s my fault bringing you on this wrong fight. But you deserve another chance to battle the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now leave!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I swam back the the land, where I could be calm and thinking clearly. Actually, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think a bit. I went straight
into coding mode, applying my programming kung-fu to illustrate the way Fourier transforms work. After 1 week, I came back
the ship with a Golang AK47 rifle that left the captain in awe.
With this awesome firepower, the project was basically done. A good understanding
of audio and the methods to manipulate it is crucial. It gave me the confidence and intuition to read papers and
implement them. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I slain the thesis with my rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was wrong. In research field, it&amp;rsquo;s not experimenting but writing that drives you crazy. I spent 1 month completing
the project, and 5 months to present it in a scientific way. And a rifle was not the right weapon, again. I needed
something subtle but lethal when executed right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain shouted out loud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pirates are coming! Prepare to melee combat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your magic won&amp;rsquo;t work now, son. You better go back, I&amp;rsquo;ll fight them for ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me look for more Go packages. I can stil&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brave heart slapped me in the face:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me nerd! There&amp;rsquo;s no open source copy-paste that can save you now. But you have to be alive to save us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go go go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back and apprenticed a blacksmith undercover sword master. He taught me the art of sword fighting and gave the
legendary sword LaTex to fight the pirates. So again, I rushed back to the fleeing ship to rescue my beloved captain and
crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was mayhem. I used LaTex to write my little thesis, it&amp;rsquo;s
an okay choice. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have beautiful format, professional looking document, but who cares, really. After
scrapping the brain for ideas, how to present them, I had to go deeper in hell writing LaTex in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&gt;SublimeText&lt;/a&gt;. And guess what,
when a syntax or semantic error pops up, only God knows where it crashes your document. Lesson learnt. Only trust LaTex
when time is out of the equation, otherwise Google Docs is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough times never last, only tough people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing is printing, of course. Every details had to be the same as it is required. A word of advice, prepare the
layout and format of the cover as many printing firms don&amp;rsquo;t have a ready template. I recommend the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inlamson.com.vn/&#34;&gt;Lam Son&lt;/a&gt; photocopy and printing shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the day of reckoning, when I had to defend against a group of elite professors and doctors. I was all in for the
technical aspect of my project. By that, I pushed the demo project to the internet, even the slides are made in a very
geeky way. The objective was to showcase the strength of engineering, though until now I doubt any member of the board
realized that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the demo, I chose the popular song at that point &lt;code&gt;We don&#39;t talk anymore&lt;/code&gt; to perform audio watermarking. It was a
reckless move I reckon. But fortunately it yielded warming results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 6 months doing research, I can firmly say that, I&amp;rsquo;d never do this again, ever. To be fair, it was a nice to have
and one time only experience, especially when I&amp;rsquo;m at the gate of adulthood. The returned attributes are invaluable for
whom intend to apply for post grad school. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Mr. Minh-Nhut Ngo, my instructor, for this wonderful tryout in the DSP field. It gave me nightmares
sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to express gratitude towards the boards, whose kind but precise comments had enhanced my thesis significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, I&amp;rsquo;d like to stop here to go out with my family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Education, my lady&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surprising to realize that we&amp;rsquo;ve known each other for a really long time, yet this is the first time we talk, like really? Our first met was so humble that I hardly recognize you from the images.
You was so complicated yet so beautiful. The way you could instantly tell whether
a number is prime was so attractive that guys keep giving
you arbitrary numbers just to hear your voice. I was in love, blindly. As time passes, I tried so
hard to befriend with you. Make friend with the librarian, apprentice the most evil profs, kill the last light, I&amp;rsquo;ve done it all.
Fortunately, it was okay, for a while. Until one day, your complexity hit me like a train. I knew that train would
come one day, but damn &amp;hellip; that algorithm.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/dFGKLIk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;leo&#34; /&gt;
You changed so fast I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even look you in the eyes, your beautiful
eyes. Even thinking about you horrified me, I was suffocated as your big Os slowly appearing in my mind. Seeing you hanging
out with other guys amplified the pain inside even more. Soon, my endurance maxed out and I dropped. You were my first, one-sided love,
yet I cowardly turned tail and ran. How miserable is that? I let the gods decide. Today, I am writing this not to pledge empathy but to seek redemption for my own mistake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I dwell in the past or something, but this is a good occasion for me to do this.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/oX5RRGN.gif&#34; alt=&#34;hart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As time passes, I entered university to be even more miserable. Like wtf? We went to the same school, again. I was drowning in
the battles inside my own head. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to hurt your parents feelings as they asked me to take care of you, but on the other hand I would have to lie to myself doing so because frankly, I disgust you to my core. I thought you would become mature with uni, but no, somehow you leave your beauty back in high school, you changed. At uni, you turn yourself into a joke, and I got news for you, it was not funny. The way I saw it, you and your friends was a big-ass joke walking around in the uni, while everyone else pretend to attentively listen and laugh. &amp;ldquo;Ha ha ha&amp;rdquo;. You guys made me sick. Ironically, doctors aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to make me sick, but your friends did. The worst part is I was trapped in this rat race. In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t notice, your parents gave me money, a lot of money, just to look after you. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give up, and it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing. Couple months passed, I stopped whining and accepted the rules. I lied to myself playing your parents game, while try my best govern the rage inside. What&amp;rsquo;s worse than 2 faces liar? I let the gods decide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am sorry for putting all over you like this, I truly am. I know now, it is not entirely because of you that I become so toxic towards love matters. I&amp;rsquo;ve been single for 3 years, and it just recently that I open myself more than often. I&amp;rsquo;d met this girl, her name is W. Right now, dating with her make me feel good about myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes. More importantly, I know now that your parents is the reason why we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be together, it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely your fault. But I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them too, parents always wish the best for their child, right? Okay, the letter&amp;rsquo;s getting long now, I better pause and reserve the good stuff for later. This is my first letter for you, there would be more, when the time comes. I am looking forward to your reply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best regards,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P/s: How&amp;rsquo;s you parents doing? Is Mr. Government still lives alone? Send my regards for your parents,okay? You should take better care of them, I heard there&amp;rsquo;s a virus called democracy going around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why I created this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-want-to-write&#34;&gt;I want to write.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel the urge to write down something that clicks people. I want to do it. And I
doing it right now. It is one of the main reasons why I&amp;rsquo;m combining my limited vocabularies
to create something barely works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/TwRKVsd.gif&#34; alt=&#34;joker&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is about eliminating poor choice of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-want-to-record-my-mind&#34;&gt;I want to record my mind.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things happend in a day and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to recall everything. So it&amp;rsquo;s better to have a place where
you can filter the good stuff and write it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create stories, we need materials. It&amp;rsquo;s in everyday life if we know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea-of-having-something-your-own-is-liberating&#34;&gt;The idea of having something your own is liberating.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;side-projects&#34;&gt;Side projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunseeker&#34;&gt;Sunseeker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is a react front-end implementation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sonhnguyen/dotastats&#34;&gt;Dotastats&lt;/a&gt;, which I also contributed into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crawled e-sports matches and statistics from various betting websites. Then we organize, display them in a sane way. The purpose of this project is to win bets ofcourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://f10k.herokuapp.com&#34;&gt;Sunseeker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;golang-web-application-boilerate&#34;&gt;Golang web application boilerate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this project to make my life and golang developers fellow easier. Where using web frameworks in Golang is a bad idea, it&amp;rsquo;s quite confusing to organize and set up necessary parts. I started this project to make my life and golang developers fellow easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at good examples of Golang web application and set up a base application with all the components in-place: middleware, router, handler, configuration, database, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still a work-in-progress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v36372/base&#34;&gt;Base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;markstream&#34;&gt;Markstream&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is my university graduation thesis. The idea is to stream audio data with watermarks embedded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, to embed a watermark into an audio segment means altering the frequencies so that they contain my information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the audio quality less degraded as possible, I need to apply a reasonable amount of modifications to the selected frequencies. There are some sensitive frequencies that are best to skip. Here I apply a dynamic scheme to determine how much should I change for a particular frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thesis is finished but there are still ideas to be improved on. I thought about recognizing audio parts where it&amp;rsquo;s hard to embed and skip those, minimizing the error rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v36372/markstream&#34;&gt;Markstream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;web-development-in-general&#34;&gt;Web development in general&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing web apps for 3 years, with projects ranging from Angular, Ionic to React and Python, Golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I picked up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://12factor.net/&#34;&gt;12 factor application&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;rsquo;ve been trying to apply it to my projects. Especially in areas like testing and deploying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;golang-web-development&#34;&gt;Golang web development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing on my friend&amp;rsquo;s Golang project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sonhnguyen/dotastats&#34;&gt;Dotastats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;python-web-development&#34;&gt;Python web development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done Django and Django rest framework application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;react-development&#34;&gt;React development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My side project &lt;a href=&#34;https://f10k.herokuapp.com&#34;&gt;Sunseeker&lt;/a&gt; is made in React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-d-love-to-work-with&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to work with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A working environment that does not focus on formal etiquette, where arriving on time isn&amp;rsquo;t a must for example. As long as I deliver good performance, I&amp;rsquo;d like to have autonomy on my working habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, any tech start-up and company would do.&lt;/p&gt;
