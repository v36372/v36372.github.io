				<p>Yesterday I witnessed the launch of iPhone X. It's futuristic looks got me right away. I'm amazed how far techonology has evolved over the past 10 years. Even I sometimes got overwhelmed by the pace, I wonder how old people deal with all those new tools. Today, let's talk about how our parents doing with the modern life.
				</p>

<p>Take my family for example, I dont know about yours but my folks cope with the new tech pretty well. Well, obviously they would need me to fix the printer everytime, but other than that, they are doing just fine. Strangly, their social network activities dominate mine. They know whats going on, you know. I totally have no clue that Singapore has a new female president, but my dad does. My mom sometimes sends cute animal videos for me. Im like, what!? There's more, I also dont know how they can access the social network in the first place. Some how they register their online identity without me knowing. As a person working in the tech scene, I know what their techonology proficiency levels are. My dad s at the "sometimes can print but sometimes cant" level, and my mom is at "how to login yahoo mail" level. Yet, somehow they snuck in the social network effortlessly. Probably props to the Facebook UX team. I got a mixed feeling about this. On one hand, I'm proud of them, being updated to the latest  try. This is good for them too, as older adults might feel lonely and bored, social network is a good place to invest their spare time. One the other hand, Im aware of dangers of the virtual world that they might step in. Even young people sometimes get depressed, scammed, bullied online. I'm sacred that my parents would someday be the victim.</p>

<p>As a son working in tech, its my duty to resolve various ranges of issues at home. From fixing the wifi to cleaning the keyboard. It's a bit frustrating logining into Yahoo Mail for my Mom at least once every weeek. I insist she should learn how to do it once and for all, but she doesn't bother. I guess she prefer her son's help, she thinks thats so sweet of me. With my Mom being so techonology illiterate, I'm worried about her online safety. Last year, she consulted me on somebody offered Bitcoin to her, I said "No, dont do it, Bitcoin is a lie". I gave her this simple answer, instead of explaining what cryptocurrency is to a 50 years old lady. Yes, if she bought it, we wouldve been rich by now, but thats not the point! What im saying is, its our young adults responsibilities to guide with kindness, steer our beloved parents away from potential danger zones on the Internet. The second you get frustrated explaining how stuff works for them, take a step back and tell yourself this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you dont assist them, they would find somebody else. What if that somebody is a bad guy trying to scam your innocent tech-illiterate Dad? Why dont you cross off the risk by being a good kid for just a little while? Consider it a privilege rather than obligation, you'll be just fine.</p>

<p>
That is my message for you guys today, marking a comeback to blogging after a long take off. What happened is I was burnt out working under stress. I quit my job, stay home and relax. Im okay now and ready for the next journey. As my interviews coming up, I need to polish my profile a little bit, whats better than a new blog post?</p>
