          I've recently joined a start-up tech company. Mediocre perks, work 6 days a week. Yep, you heard that right, I work on Saturday. Honestly, I hardly believed it myself that I took this position. Of course, higher performance is better. But for me, working in half of weekend always make the other half feels like shit.
        </p>

<p>
  I took this job for one thing. People. My work environment is the most energetic by far. Dudes with man-bun, girls with dyed hair. All kinds, all types. Everyone have their own interesting story to tell. My last company is more of a old-school type. Married, kids even. Boring. I have nothing against being settled down, guys. Trust me, I'd love to have a serious relationship (which I don't, feelsbadman). Maybe it's just I have different wavelengths with married people.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, one of my colleagues, there is a beautiful lady. Blonde hair, good-looking face, and ... let's just say she is in good shape (if you know what i meant). LOL, sorry, I'd stop being sexist from here on. But the point is, this woman is gorgeous and her name is Tiffany. 
</p>

<p>
  First day in, I looked at this girl once every 30 seconds. Yep. Good job being a creep at the first day of your employment.
</p>

<p>
But, There's something weird about Tiffany. Everytime I glanced at her, she looked right at me. Her face is just blank. No emotional expression whatsoever. Just stared at me. I was too embarrassed to continue looking, back to my computer pretended working on something. On the edge of my eyes, I saw her head turned away too. But when I looked again, there she was, doing staring contest. Like she knew when would I look.
</p>

<p>
I think Tiffany is an antisocial person. I never see her talk to others. She uses Slack to communicate. I wonder what her position is, maybe a secretary, she always run around handle people papers.
</p>

<p>
Tiffany can cook. She is the only person prepared and brought lunch from home. She would put her food in the microwave and the smell is always so good that it's like a reminder for everyone else to went out for lunch. I guess she a good cook. One day, an unfinished feature really made my lose the time. When I finished, it was already 12h30m. Everyone has gone out for lunch. I glanced to the eating zone and saw Tiffany. Staring at me again. I felt a little uncomfortable and looked away. Finally, when she went out to wash up. I took my lunch to the eating zone, and you won't believe what I saw in Tiffany's lunch box. Finger nails!!! Dozens of them. Did she just had lunch and then trim her nails right after?
</p>

<p>
I've read somewhere on the Internet that, the hotness level of a girl is in proportional to her craziness. This is the first time I can confirm an online dating advice.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hey, what's the deal with Tiffany?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I ask my mentor. His facial expression slightly changes, like my question triggers something.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Why'd you ask? You've seen her?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Seen? What do you mean?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My mentor grabs my shirt.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Have you seen her? Yes or No?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Y... Yes. Doesn't she come to work everyday?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I answer in stutter.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Fuck. This is bad. She's came back
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
WTF does that mean?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Fuck. This is bad. She's came back
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Can you explain? For 1 second?
</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p>
Tiffany worked here 4 months ago, just before you joined. One day, she OTed. A robber broke in the office, raped and killed her.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
You're saying she's dead?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I'm afraid so, Justin
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
You must be joking, she is right there!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I furiously point to her desk, where she usually sits, all left was an old empty chair. Wait, WTF? I swear I can see Tiffany on the edge of my eyes just minutes ago. WTF is happening? Am I getting insane? Seeing a ghost of a person I've never met in real life. My mentor linked up an old article regarding the incident. My legs feels weak as I read the post.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hey, hey, calm the fuck down
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
What'd you mean she has came back?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
What'd you mean she has came back?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What'd you mean she has came back?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It's nothing. We missed her so much we wanted her to see her again that's all
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He is hiding something. Something I shouldn't know. He urged me to back to work. Tasks and deadlines put my mind briefly away for the rest of this hectic day.
</p>

<p>
I'm back at home, scaring as shit typing this post. So many questions running through my mind right now.
</p>

<p>
Why only me can see Tiffany?
Why my mentor is hiding stuff from me?
What does this ghost want?
</p>

<p>
What do I do, guys?
</p>
