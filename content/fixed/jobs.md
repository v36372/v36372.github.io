## Side projects

### Sunseeker

The project is a react front-end implementation for [Dotastats](https://github.com/sonhnguyen/dotastats), which I also contributed into.

We crawled e-sports matches and statistics from various betting websites. Then we organize, display them in a sane way. The purpose of this project is to win bets ofcourse.

The site can be found at [Sunseeker](https://f10k.herokuapp.com)

### Golang web application boilerate

I started this project to make my life and golang developers fellow easier. Where using web frameworks in Golang is a bad idea, it's quite confusing to organize and set up necessary parts. I started this project to make my life and golang developers fellow easier. 

I looked at good examples of Golang web application and set up a base application with all the components in-place: middleware, router, handler, configuration, database, etc...

Still a work-in-progress

The project can be found at [Base](https://github.com/v36372/base)

### Markstream

This one is my university graduation thesis. The idea is to stream audio data with watermarks embedded.

In my case, to embed a watermark into an audio segment means altering the frequencies so that they contain my information.

To make the audio quality less degraded as possible, I need to apply a reasonable amount of modifications to the selected frequencies. There are some sensitive frequencies that are best to skip. Here I apply a dynamic scheme to determine how much should I change for a particular frequency. 

The thesis is finished but there are still ideas to be improved on. I thought about recognizing audio parts where it's hard to embed and skip those, minimizing the error rate.

## I'd love to work with

A working environment that does not focus on formal etiquette, where arriving on time isn't a must for example. As long as I deliver good performance, I'd like to have autonomy on my working habit.

Outside of that, any tech start-up, company would do.
