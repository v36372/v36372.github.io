## About

Hi, I am Tin, a software engineer based in Saigon, Vietnam.

I love building software and products in general.

When I'm bored, reading and writing are my options to escape reality. Like computers, right? I/O operations are the most common activities.

I'm currently work at [Floating Cube Studios](http://floatingcube.com), also based in Saigon. We develop point of sale products and packages for small to middle size clients in Singapore. 

I don't call myself a writer, but I'm trying to fit in the writing habit.
There's something about crafting sentences that lures me into creating this blog and start putting my thoughts online.
I personally think the choice of words is art. 
Strangely, I can't write in my mother tongue, yet, the feeling of cringing keeps striking me. 
It's something I definitely should work on, as this practice of literacy possibly be my main activity in the next 10 years.
And writing in English is not a good approach for a non-native speaker, in a country that doesn't speak the language.
At the moment, I'm enjoying the freedom of burden and write whatever I want. 
But in the long run, screenwriting is what I'm aiming for.

If you are a writer of any kind and located in Saigon, drop me a buzz and I buy you a drink! ;)
