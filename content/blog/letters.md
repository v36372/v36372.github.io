*Hi Education, my lady*

*It's surprising to realize that we've known each other for a really long time, yet this is the first time we talk, like really? Our first met was so humble that I hardly recognize you from the images.
You was so complicated yet so beautiful. The way you could instantly tell whether
a number is prime was so attractive that guys keep giving
you arbitrary numbers just to hear your voice. I was in love, blindly. As time passes, I tried so
hard to befriend with you. Make friend with the librarian, apprentice the most evil profs, kill the last light, I've done it all.
Fortunately, it was okay, for a while. Until one day, your complexity hit me like a train. I knew that train would
come one day, but damn ... that algorithm.

You changed so fast I couldn't even look you in the eyes, your beautiful
eyes. Even thinking about you horrified me, I was suffocated as your big Os slowly appearing in my mind. Seeing you hanging
out with other guys amplified the pain inside even more. Soon, my endurance maxed out and I dropped. You were my first, one-sided love,
yet I cowardly turned tail and ran. How miserable is that? I let the gods decide. Today, I am writing this not to pledge empathy but to seek redemption for my own mistake.*

>It's not that I dwell in the past or something, but this is a good occasion for me to do this.

*As time passes, I entered university to be even more miserable. Like wtf? We went to the same school, again. I was drowning in
the battles inside my own head. I don't want to hurt your parents feelings as they asked me to take care of you, but on the other hand I would have to lie to myself doing so because frankly, I disgust you to my core. I thought you would become mature with uni, but no, somehow you leave your beauty back in high school, you changed. At uni, you turn yourself into a joke, and I got news for you, it was not funny. The way I saw it, you and your friends was a big-ass joke walking around in the uni, while everyone else pretend to attentively listen and laugh. "Ha ha ha". You guys made me sick. Ironically, doctors aren't supposed to make me sick, but your friends did. The worst part is I was trapped in this rat race. In case you haven't notice, your parents gave me money, a lot of money, just to look after you. I couldn't give up, and it's a bad thing. Couple months passed, I stopped whining and accepted the rules. I lied to myself playing your parents game, while try my best govern the rage inside. What's worse than 2 faces liar? I let the gods decide.*

*I am sorry for putting all over you like this, I truly am. I know now, it is not entirely because of you that I become so toxic towards love matters. I've been single for 3 years, and it just recently that I open myself more than often. I'd met this girl, her name is W. Right now, dating with her make me feel good about myself, I'll see how this goes. More importantly, I know now that your parents is the reason why we couldn't be together, it's not entirely your fault. But I can't blame them too, parents always wish the best for their child, right? Okay, the letter's getting long now, I better pause and reserve the good stuff for later. This is my first letter for you, there would be more, when the time comes. I am looking forward to your reply.*

*Best regards,*

*T*

*P/s: How's you parents doing? Is Mr. Government still lives alone? Send my regards for your parents,okay? You should take better care of them, I heard there's a virus called democracy going around.*
