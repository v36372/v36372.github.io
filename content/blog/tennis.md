"Think I probably quit playing"

He says while staring at the guitar.

"But you've been doing this for like ... 2 months?"

"Yeah, but you know, things get in the way"

"That is the worst excuse you can give"

"Sorry ..."

"... So? What happened"

"It was nothing, just that I played terribly is all"

"Now you're lying. No wonder she said it's so difficult to get something out of you"

"She said that? When?"

"Now you care? Say you tell your story, I'll tell mine"

"Fine, you got me"

"Hehe, I'm your best friend"

"I got scolded by the instructor"

"So you hit him and got suspended?"

"I'm serious. But yeah, that would be worth it to quit"

"You hate him that much?"

"Everybody hates him"

"Wow, then he must be very good to have so many haters"

"Yeah, he's pretty good. But hey, which side are you on?"

"Sorry. What did he do?"

"He shouted at me for not in tune"

"You could've been killed"

"It wasn't a big deal, we was just practicing"

"Okay. Maybe he pressure you to play better?"

"No, he was just fucking with students I'm sure as hell"

"Like abuse them mentally?"

"Yeah like that, one time he made a little girl cry for not bringing the sheets"

"This bastard"

"Right? Right?"

"So what're you gonna do?"

"Guess find another class. This asshole is too toxic to nurture my music talent"

"You aren't gonna quit anymore? I saved a future musician hehe"

"Lul, it's something called strong will"

"Give me a break"

"So did she say anything else about me?"

"Which one?"

"Wait, are we talking about the same girl?"

"Omg, quick, say theirs hair color out at once"

"Blonde"

"..."

"Why didn't ..."

"Wait, think I should call someone"

"Who?"

"In that moment of desicion, I suddenly want her to talk about me"

"Hehe, beers solve problems I guess"

"True that, hehe"
