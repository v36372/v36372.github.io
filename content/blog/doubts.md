Hi,

Right off the bat, I apologize for this long and unexpected email. I like to write down and arrange everything, something I can't do in face to face encounter.

I need help.

As you knew, I am a software engineer. But it seems that I also have genuine passion toward creative creation in general. Say it cheesy but I feel like making something that I hope would carry a mission to change, even smallest as possible, something fundamental even, on the audience.

In specifics, writing screenplay catches my attention recently. I see the potential in crafting dialogues and scenes, how it can transform into movies. Movies that tell stories with powerful devices to transform audience into better versions of themselves. I hope my work would spark a little thought of kindness in people.

But painfully, I don't feel like starting to work on this. I dont have a drive to move me forward. Clouds of doubts shadows the writing notebook. I'm not sure where this writing path would lead me to. After all it's the creative product making that I am interested in, and this can happen in a lot of other fields, even at my current career as establishing a tech startup. Why jump into this high risk playground? 

On the other hand, another thing I like doing is playing football. I play every Monday and Thursday. Those are the weekdays I look forward to. Honestly, deep down, there is a call for professional football. And it is a shame that I became aware of this a bit too late. Kids would aim to go pro in football when they turn 10. Me,  a 22 years old dude with height issue, questioning about the ridiculous chances I might have in this career. But I can imagine, it would be a definitively joyful journey. Playing football everyweek gives me a glimpse of my distant yet surely happiness. 

So my plan is to cross the professional football path and go for something else sustainable to provide for my regular football hobby. It feels like chopping one finger off and comforting yourself at the same time as you have nine left. To me, it's okay as long as I am on the field. This fact describes my drives for the sport to some degrees.

Here is the problem. I am obsessed with this game. It gives me trouble sleeping as I would spend hours nightly thinking about the whatifs in the previous football match. What I could've done. I subconsciously recall the details of my touches with the ball and how I handled each situation. I couldn't help but drowning in the stream of thougths about my performance. I am obsessed with this game. Eyes closed but my body still reacts to the moves I wished I would've played.

I'd experienced this before. It was when I play DotA 2 for hours before going to sleep in 3 am only because of morning school. Still, lying on the bed doesnt make me sleepy. I keep thinking about the choices, actions I made in the past games. Sometimes even worse, I open the laptop and browse to the match statistics site, only to check the numbers and winrate. Going pro in DotA 2 sometimes even pass by  to say hello and disappears right away. Lucky I still had some senses left.

The behavior I presented is the kind I want for my serious work. I want to be hypnotized like that in my writing game. Something is missing. Is there a logical explanation for this? Or it is just simple that everyone would fall into a blackhole created by themselves if they overspend time into something? Is it just some people would simply prefer games, playful, relaxing activities over "creative work"? What can I do to feel the way I want to feel about my dream?

Best regards,

Tin NG
